    <title>JavaScript for impatient programmers (ES2022 edition)</title>
    <subtitle>This book makes JavaScript less challenging to learn for newcomers by offering a modern view that is as consistent as possible.</subtitle>
    <description>Some advanced language features are not explained, but references to appropriate material are provided â€“ for example, to my other JavaScript books at ExploringJS.com, which are free to read online. This book deliberately focuses on the language. Browser-only features, etc are not described</description>
